# k_cipher
This encryption is still in the test stage.

## Important Notice:
Please do not (yet) use the cipher. It is still in the development stage and many tests are still necessary. 

## The acceptance criteria were:
- easy to learn how it works (must be understood by an 8-year-old child)
- the key must not be limited in its length
- the code must work quickly and can be created with just a few lines
- the encryption must withstand common decryption methods

### Functionality:
The test will be converted from a string to a binary code.
The key runs through the text with 1 bit each. So every bit in the key will
generate a substitution for every bit of the text.
 substitution = t âŠ• k;

```
key.foreach( key ->
    { 
    text.foreach(textBit -> {
        append(textBit ^ key)
    }
} 
```

The text to be encrypted is then moved by 1 bit. 
Here the 1 bit set decides whether negative or positive. 
This decision is set by the true / false state of the actual key-bit.

### Example
We got the Text "hello" as binary notation: <br> 
```011010000110010101101100011011000110111100001010```<br>
And we got a very small key (this time only two letters a and h): <br> 
```0110010101101000```<br> 
We pass the first bit of the key to every bit of the text:
The key bit is 0.
We run trough every bit of the Text as XOR.
``` 
0 ^ 0 = 1 
0 ^ 1 = 0 
0 ^ 1 = 0 
...
```
The Result is: <br> 
```100111111001101010010011100100111001000011110101```<br>
This is a very common and simple encryption/substitution.
Now we move the bitset to the left, cause the boolean meaning of the key bit is false.
So we got: <br>
```110011111100110101001001110010011100100001111010```<br>
This will happend for every bit of the key.
